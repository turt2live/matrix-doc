      summary: Invalidates all access tokens for a user
      description: |-
        Invalidates all access tokens for a user, so that they can no longer be used for
        authorization. This includes the access token that made this request. 

        This endpoint does not require UI authorization because UI authorization is
        designed to protect against attacks where the someone gets hold of a single access
        token then takes over the account. This endpoint invalidates all access tokens for
        the user, including the token used in the request, and therefore the attacker is
        unable to take over the account in this way.
