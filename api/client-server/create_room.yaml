      summary: Create a new room
      description: |-
        Create a new room with various configuration options.

        The server MUST apply the normal state resolution rules when creating
        the new room, including checking power levels for each event. It MUST
        apply the events implied by the request in the following order:

        0. A default ``m.room.power_levels`` event, giving the room creator
           (and not other members) permission to send state events.
        
        1. Events set by ``presets``.

        2. Events listed in ``initial_state``, in the order that they are
           listed.

        3. Events implied by ``name`` and ``topic``.

        4. Invite events implied by ``invite`` and ``invite_3pid``.

                description: |-
                  A ``public`` visibility indicates that the room will be shown
                  in the published room list. A ``private`` visibility will hide
                  the room from the published room list. Rooms default to
                  ``private`` visibility if this key is not included. NB: This
                  should not be confused with ``join_rules`` which also uses the
                  word ``public``.
              room_alias_name:
                type: string

                  The desired room alias **local part**. If this is included, a
                  room alias will be created and mapped to the newly created
                  room. The alias will belong on the *same* homeserver which
                  created the room. For example, if this was set to "foo" and
                  sent to the homeserver "example.com" the complete room alias
                  would be ``#foo:example.com``.

                  If this is included, an ``m.room.name`` event will be sent
                  into the room to indicate the name of the room. See Room
                  Events for more information on ``m.room.name``.

                type: string
                description: |-
                  If this is included, an ``m.room.topic`` event will be sent
                  into the room to indicate the topic for the room. See Room
                  Events for more information on ``m.room.topic``.

                  The server will clobber the following keys: ``creator``. Future
                  versions of the specification may allow the server to clobber
                  other keys.
              initial_state:
                type: array
                description: |-
                  A list of state events to set in the new room. This allows
                  the user to override the default state events set in the new
                  room. The expected format of the state events are an object
                  with type, state_key and content keys set.

                  Takes precedence over events set by ``presets``, but gets
                  overriden by ``name`` and ``topic`` keys.

                description: |-
                  Convenience parameter for setting various default state events
                  based on a preset. Must be either:

                  ``private_chat`` =>
                    ``join_rules`` is set to ``invite``.
                    ``history_visibility`` is set to ``shared``.

                  ``trusted_private_chat`` =>
                      ``join_rules`` is set to ``invite``.
                      ``history_visibility`` is set to ``shared``.
                      All invitees are given the same power level as the room creator.

                  ``public_chat``: =>
                      ``join_rules`` is set to ``public``.
                      ``history_visibility`` is set to ``shared``.

                type: boolean
                description: |-
                  This flag makes the server set the ``is_direct`` flag on the
                  ``m.room.member`` events sent to the users in ``invite`` and
                  ``invite_3pid``. See `Direct Messaging`_ for more information.
              guest_can_join:
                type: boolean

            The request is invalid. A meaningful ``errcode`` and description
            error text will be returned. Example reasons for rejection include:

            - The request body is malformed (``errcode`` set to ``M_BAD_JSON``
              or ``M_NOT_JSON``).

            - The room alias specified is already taken (``errcode`` set to
              ``M_ROOM_IN_USE``).

            - The initial state implied by the parameters to the request is
              invalid: for example, the user's ``power_level`` is set below
              that necessary to set the room name (``errcode`` set to
              ``M_INVALID_ROOM_STATE``).
