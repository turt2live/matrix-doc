      summary: Receive and validate a CAS login ticket.
      description: |-
        Once the CAS server has authenticated the user, it will redirect the
        browser to this endpoint (assuming |/login/cas/redirect|_ gave it the
        correct ``service`` parameter).

        The server MUST call ``/proxyValidate`` on the CAS server, to validate
        the ticket supplied by the browser.

        If validation is successful, the server must generate a Matrix login
        token. It must then respond with an HTTP redirect to the URI given in
        the ``redirectUrl`` parameter, adding a ``loginToken`` query parameter
        giving the generated token.

        If validation is unsuccessful, the server should respond with a ``401
        Unauthorized`` error, the body of which will be displayed to the user.
