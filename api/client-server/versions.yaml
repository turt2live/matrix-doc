        Gets the versions of the specification supported by the server.

        Values will take the form ``rX.Y.Z``.

        Only the latest ``Z`` value will be reported for each supported ``X.Y`` value.
        i.e. if the server implements ``r0.0.0``, ``r0.0.1``, and ``r1.2.0``, it will report ``r0.0.1`` and ``r1.2.0``.
